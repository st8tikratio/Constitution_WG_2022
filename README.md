## Background

The Cardano Constitution Working Group was created as part of the Gimbalabs Tokenomics PBL to explore, discuss and draft an outline to a community constitution.

## Location

The Constitution WG lives on here in this repository (mainly this page). The respective Discord channel has been archived. In order to view the channel one must join the [Gimbalabs Discord server](https://discord.gg/fEykcQejDf) and then select the role of `archivist`. Selecting this role will allowing viewing of the `Archived - Tokenomics PBL` category which houses the `Constitutiton WG` channel.

## Working Group Composition

#### Initial Group

Initially there was great interest among a few members of the PBL Tokenomics group. As the weeks progressed, and time passed, interest waned. Those early participants are important in many ways, just as discourse is. To the community: Without it there would be nothing remotely relevant. No data. No feedback. Thank you.
